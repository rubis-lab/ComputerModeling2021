Report 1
by PUCHER Thomas (2021-82520)

First of all I decided to not change the name of the design.xml, CC.cpp and LK.cpp 
since the code would not compile anymore if I do so, and in the second task there
was also no mention of changing the Executor.cpp for example to anything with my student ID.
All the newly created files such as this report and the log file have my ID in there as requested.
I hope this is ok.

The Base Time that I observed was a 2:13.

In order to increase the speed of the car I made some changes in the design.xml (through the eclipse module interface). 
I simply scaled all the values down while still keeping the execution time at 20. 
That means that all the periods are now 200, the execution times for CC and LK are 20, the execution times for
Sensing, Brake, Power and Local are 40.

In the LK.cpp I implemented some smooth steering. Meaning the steering value is incremented in +100 unit steps. 
Further I also capped the max steering angle at 1000. This is well enough for the car to make all necessary turns
while preventing all the over steering that happened in the original version.

In the CC.cpp I increased the max speed value.
For 80kmh my lap time was 1:16 for the first lap and around 1:10 - 1:11 for the second.
But this was sadly not always 100% consistent. Meaning not every run would finish, but instead crash.
So I decreased the speed to 75kmh, which results in consistent runs. Now the time is 1:21 for the first lap
and 1:15 for the second.
