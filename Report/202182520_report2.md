In general:
You can enter the task to be logged in the settings.txt
I only log read and writes of the set task. (As instructed)
I log the header of the log file in the constructor of the Logger.
Every log function call is then appended to the file.

Case #1:
As the assignment instructions say we have to call the log function in the Job.cpp, which is what I did.
A comment in the Job.cpp says that a job is the instance of a certain task. So when we log a task,
we basically log the jobs read and writes. 
I can call my log function through the global_object::logger shared pointer in Utils.h.
In void Job::run_function() these read and writes can be found.
Depending on what the branch if((get_is_read() == true) && (get_is_write() == true)) says,
we either read and write, only read or only write. 
We read before the run() function and write after the run() function. So this is where I log.
The reads come from the TaggedData, so I log all the reads from there including the time there.
The writes come from the DelayedData, so I log all the writes from there including the time there.
Due to shortage of time during the finals I didn't fully implement the hex code conversion.
The length shows the length of the integer data I write. Also the formatting is a bit more basic.

Case #2:
As the assignment instructions say we have to implement the calls of the logger in the Executor.cpp
There we can find a Executor::run_simulation function which simulates the Jobs.
There the Job states are set, e.g. job->set_is_released(true).
So this is where I log the events as well.
The Job has a get_simulated_release_time() as well as a get_actual_release_time().
Before logging the FINISHED I check if the finish time is smaller or equal to the deadline
to differentiate a normal finished from a deadline miss finished.
Since we want to track the events of the REAL cyber system we need to use the actual time.
Also the Job Id I get from the Job itself by calling job->get_job_id().
Also here the printing is a bit more basic due to time struggles.
